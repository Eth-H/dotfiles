2020-06-30 20:07:00	nvz	Lady_Aleena: is your concern freeing up disk space?
2020-06-30 20:07:50	nvz	because ~/.thumbnails and ~/.cache/thumbnails are typically the larger of the dirs for people who use a GUI file manager..
2020-06-30 20:08:00	Lady_Aleena	nvz, I was working on something else and thought getting the .cache cleared would help. It did not, though it is nice to have the browsers' caches cleared.
2020-06-30 20:08:34	Lady_Aleena	It appears that the browsers are NOT clearing the caches when they close.

2020-06-30 20:09:02	nvz	Lady_Aleena: you can also do crap like making a dir like "mkdir tmp; HOME=tmp/ mycommand" and run something in a clean home to see how it functions
2020-06-30 20:09:18	nvz	you'll know then what dirs it creates and how it behaves with no data

2020-06-30 20:09:53	greycat	Not everything will blindly respect the HOME variable, though.
2020-06-30 20:10:00	nvz	this wont typically effect other things like the env, the dbus/dconf, stuff in /tmp etc..
2020-06-30 20:10:31	greycat	also, you would want HOME to be an absolute path
2020-06-30 20:10:35	Lady_Aleena	However, I do want to get $HOME as small as possible when I go to back it up somewhere. I am thinking about taking out my current hard drive soon and doing a fresh install of Buster on a new drive.
